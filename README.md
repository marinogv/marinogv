### Hi there ðŸ‘‹

I'm a Web Developer transitioning from UX Design. I'm currently specializing in Full Stack Web Development at Puc Minas and doing a second major in Information Systems at the same institution.
I have experience building digital products, managing design systems and working with agile teams.
